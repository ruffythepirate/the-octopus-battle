# Introduction

This is what happens when octopuses are left by themselves alone in space - they start throwing astroid at each other!!

# Building

This is a monorepo. To build start in the root folder and run:
- npm install
- npm run build

# Starting

From your root folder run `npm run start`. This will spin up a server for multiplayer as well as a webpage that will run the application.
